# TomatoSlakin

TomatoSlakin, for boosting you productivity in a fun way with the pomodoro technique. Recieve alerts once the time is over.

In the Gemfile add:

source 'https://rubygems.org'

gem 'slack-ruby-bot'
gem 'celluloid-io'
gem 'giphy'


Create your bot, get your API key and run it ... 

SLACK_API_TOKEN=... bundle exec ruby thomas_magnum.rb

For this implementation, as the sound plays in the server side,so when the client uses a command it is played in the computer functioning as server. 

Enjoy!
